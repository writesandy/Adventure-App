# IMPORTANT: HOW TO WORK ON THE CODE
***Please do all your work on the develop branch, and then merge those changes into master***
1. git checkout develop
2. git pull 
3. Make your changes where you need them
4. Git add (the files you edited) 
5. Git commit -m "your commit message" 
6. git push 

***If your change is good to go into master branch***
1. git checkout master 
2. git merge develop 
(This takes any changes from DEVELOP and merges them IN TO master) 

***If you accidentally make changes directly to master, just make sure to pull them BACK to dev***
1. git checkout develop
2. git merge master 
(This takes any changes from MASTER and merges them BACK TO develop)
